Scaffold hoststack
==================

To compile:

First time you check out, prepare the build system:

# ./autogen.sh

To configure the build system:

# ./configure [ --enable-debug | --disable-kernel ]

To build:

# make

Directory structure
-------------------
include/		headers that are shared between components under src/.

src/			source code.

src/stack		stack code.

src/stack/linux		stack code specific for the linux kernel.

src/stack/userlevel	stack code specific for user level.

src/libstack		library that makes it easy to interact with the stack 
			from user space independent of stack version.

src/scafd		user space control daemon for the stack (uses libstack).

src/test		test programs for the stack.

src/libscaffold		socket API abstraction for client applications interacting 
			with  user level version of the stack.

Cross-compile Linux kernel module
---------------------------------

Run ./configure to generate Makefiles

Enter src/stack and issue the following command (example for Android):

> make scaffold.ko ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<Path to NDK)/android-ndk-r4b/build/prebuilt/darwin-x86/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin/arm-eabi- KDIR=<Path to kernel source>
